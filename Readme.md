# RB-Trees
This repository contains code for the in-depth examination of the course data structures and algorithms for data physics A.A 2024/2025 unimi.

It is a simple c++ implementation of the RB-tree data structure complete with its signature operations: insertion removal and search.

## Usage 

During the implementation I experimented with the cmake tool for compilation.

To compile the code, create a build directory, inside it run

```
cmake --build .
```
or
```
make
```

 The rbTree executable will be created. After that to run the program run

 ```
./rbTree
```

The program contains all the basic instructions needed to experiment with all the various operations. If you prefer you can build the tree from a list of values contained in a .txt file, I have left some example ones in a folder.

The whole program was built following the book 

*Introduction to Algorithms* by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein
